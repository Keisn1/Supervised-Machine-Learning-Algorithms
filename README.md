# Machine-Learning-Algos
Bunch of machine learning algorithms

In this repository I develop a bunch of machine learning algorithm.
In particular algorithms that I learned via studying at Udemy under course
Instructor Lazyprogrammer Inc. https://lazyprogrammer.me/ https://deeplearningcourses.com/

Although I can honestly say that I wrote this code myself, there are a lot of similarites
to the code find at the page of lazyprogrammer and all tribute goes to him.
